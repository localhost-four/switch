# --- Context ---  <br>
A game about a cat farm that collects switches.
Your task is to check the switches and hire new workers, depending on the payment of taxes.
You can also buy points with jobs, they increase the income from one employee and everything else.

The idea for this creation came to me from a meme of a cat playing with a light.

Also, during the passage, you will receive impressions that are temporary, and there are forever, depending on their purpose in the list.
Progress will be saved depending on your actions.
